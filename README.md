This project is a website featuring an *AI-powered ASL* sign language detector that recognizes hand gestures, making communication easier for the **deaf** and **hard-of-hearing** community. Additionally, it includes an *AI-based object recognition tool* that reads out loud common items to assist **blind** and **visually impaired** users.
